            My name is Lilian Wakely and I'm a Software Engineering student currently attending school
            at centennial college. I love computers and it drove me to pursue schooling in the field too.

            My biggest hobby is playing games and I adore competing as well. I have a cat named Billy
            who may be a big pain but also he can be a sweetheart. I hope to go into game development
            one day and make my own game.
